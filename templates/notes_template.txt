PHYSICS NOTES - MECHANICS
==========================

FORCE AND MOTION
----------------
Force is a push or pull that can change the motion of an object. The SI unit of force is the Newton (N).

Newton's Laws of Motion:
1. First Law (Inertia): An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.

2. Second Law: Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma)

3. Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

WORK AND ENERGY
---------------
Work is done when a force moves an object through a distance. Work = Force × Distance

Kinetic Energy: KE = 1/2 mv²
Potential Energy: PE = mgh

The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

MOMENTUM
---------
Momentum is the product of mass and velocity (p = mv). Momentum is conserved in closed systems.

FORMULAS TO REMEMBER:
- Force: F = ma
- Work: W = Fd
- Kinetic Energy: KE = 1/2 mv²
- Potential Energy: PE = mgh
- Momentum: p = mv
